					<h2 class="box-title">FISC Global Foundation</h2>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">
						The FISC Global Singapore Foundation is voluntarily formed by the world’s top ten most representative companies, scientific research institutions, financial service institutions and elites in various fields which aims to build the ecological foundation of digital assets and continue to attract more individuals, communities, and enterprises. FISC Global Foundation is an organization dedicated to promoting the development of IPFS, involving investment finance, blockchain digital assets, global data centers, custody, and trust fund. The foundation is equipped with a senior investment and technical consultant team, to achieve seamless connection between supply and demand parties in the data industry, and promote collaborative innovatiotn and facilitate the incubation of high-quality blockchain projects.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">
						FISC Global Singapore Foundation believes that under the new blockchain economy model, breaking through barriers of country, region, language, and circulation, FISC Global Singapore Foundation will help the data-centric digital economy alliance achieve rapid development. 
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">						
						FISC Global Singapore Foundation will open up data resources in various industries around the world and change the productivity relationships of all roles in the business model through FISC Global Singapore Foundation.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">						
						To better promote the global development of the FISC Global Singapore Foundation Digital Asset Alliance.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">						
						We will issue encrypted digital assets FISC as the general Token in the FISC Global Singapore Foundation ecology. Based on the ecological incentives of this Token and the capabilities of FISC Global Singapore Foundation’s infrastructure, we expect to build a prosperous ecosystem.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">						
						In order to ensure the transparency of the FISC project, FISC established the highest decision-making body-FISC Global Singapore Foundation for management, and the FISC Global Singapore Foundation established SIDAM (Singapore International Digital Asset Mining) for management. With the participation of the FISC Global Foundation, the FISC Passport System will assist in the development of the IPFS ecology.
					</p>
					<h2 class="box-title" style="padding-top:40px;">FISC Global Foundation Supervision</h2>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">
						In order to ensure the efficiency and transparency of FISC, it is necessary to supervise the entire Filecoin mining activities with 5P computing power. Due to the application of blockchain technology, the various data generated will be recorded and cannot be tampered with. Therefore, SIDAM mining can monitor its own internal supervision and trust each other; while the FISC Autonomous Committee is set up to oversee the investor community meeting and conduct dual supervision to ensure the interests of stakeholders. The Autonomous Committee is reset every year according to the number of tokens held. 
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">							
						In addition, it is necessary to set up consultants for auditing, law, finance, etc., to conduct regular and irregular information disclosure in the form of reports and news. The contact information of the main person in charge of the board of directors must be open and accept the contact and supervision of all parties. And through the two-way channel of supervision and reporting, users, mining circle participants, and investors are welcome to participate in management, supervision and operation, and report problems, major crises, fraud, fraud and other issues in the operation of FISC.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">							
						The FISC operation team has been extensively involved in the Filecoin industry for more than 3 years and has accumulated more than 50P filecoin mining power in the entire network, as well as constituting large IDC groups around the world.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc about-desc-new">							
						At the same time, these founding partners will form a partnership Governance Committee FISC project, including joint decision making, major development issues of liquidity management, and the future direction. At the same time, as mining assets are involved, multi-party signatures will also be adopted in the near future to ensure maximum security.

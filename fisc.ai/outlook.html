					<p class="about-desc">
						With the recent negative news spreading across the globe, the price of cryptocurrency continues to plunge, and panics are spreading. However, according to the Flying Spur browser, the FIL coin's entire network computing power is in a state of rapid growth.Even with the negative market sentiment, we can see that the FIL ecosystem is enhancing and evolving into a matured environment.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc">
						This shows that IPFS/FIL is a long-term investment value project. With the implementation of IPFS in more fields, the currency price of FIL will surely rebound and rise. IPFS distributed storage technology, as a powerful technology that is expected to work for new infrastructure, rather than a high-energy-consuming Bitcoin mining project, it is basically difficult to have a targeted suppression policy introduced; internationally recognized, the current mining cost is relatively lower.
					</p>
					<h2 class="box-title">Solutions</h2>
					<p class="about-desc">
						The goal is to build a standardized and efficient grayscale for the IPFS ecology, effectively connecting the primary market and the secondary market thus strongly contributing to the development of the IPFS ecology.

						FISC is a standard representative of the 5P effective mining power.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc-left about-desc-left-new">
						FISC strictly follows the mining efficiency of miner nodes disclosed on the Filecoin blockchain browser to allocate mining revenue to FISC stakers, and FISC is obliged to ensure that the mining efficiency is higher than the market average.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc-left">
						In order to gain more support from miners, the FISC Project Management Committee will prioritize cooperation with excellent miner nodes with higher mining efficiency based on the data disclosed on the whole network, allowing miners to be a part of the community as a node in the entire ecosystem.
					</p>
					<p class="box-little-title">Low Threshold and High Efficiency</p>
					<p class="about-desc-left about-desc-left-new">
						FISC has created a broader Filecoin computing power market, allowing global compliance funds to enter and exit the market efficiently.
					</p>
					<p class="about-desc-left">
						Every FISC minting represents the real and effective Filecoin standard full storage computing power is invested in the Filecoin mining network. Miners holding FISC can conduct Filecoin mining with low threshold and high efficiency.
					</p>
					<p class="box-little-title">Broad Market and High Return</p>
					<p class="about-desc-left">
						Since the price of FISC represents the real and effective Filecoin standard computing power, FISC represents potential mining capacity and future earnings. Therefore, in the secondary market, FISC is a Token with no liquidation risk and high-value leverage capabilities.
